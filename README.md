# Volatility-Based-Risk-Management-Case-Study

Analyzes asset risk using historical volatility to adjust position size dynamically. Shows how reducing exposure during periods of high risk can protect against large losses.

- Volatility measured by 20-day rolling standard deviation
- Position size cut in half during top 25% volatility days, else fully invested
- Compares cumulative returns and risk metrics to buy-and-hold

## How to Run
- Open the code notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter, run all cells
- Download RiskManagementCaseStudy_Volatility.xlsx for results

## Example Resume Bullet Point:
- Built and backtested a volatility-adjusted trading strategy, dynamically resizing portfolio exposure in response to risk, achieving improved drawdown control and risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe ratio) compared to passive buy-and-hold. Automated data and output pipeline using Python and Excel.
